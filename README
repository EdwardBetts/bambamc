This package contains mainly a lightwight C implementation of the read name
collation code from the larger bambam C++ project (see
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/users/gt1).

The gibhub repository does not contain the final configure script but only
the source files passed to autoconf/automake. Please use

autoreconf -i -f

to obtain a set of working configuration scripts.
