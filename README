This package contains mainly a lightwight C implementation of the read name
collation code from the larger bambam C++ project (see
ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/users/gt1). bambamc currently requires the the
samtools library. To compile bambamc you first need to compile samtools and
then point the configure script of bambamc to the samtools directory using
the --with-samtools=<dir> option. On recent versions of Ubuntu the samtools
library can be installed via the libbam-dev package (sudo apt-get
install libbam-dev). If this package is installed, the bambamc configure
script should automatically find the library without any need for using
--with-samtools.
